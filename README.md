# All Strangeness on the Ground: Translating the Middle English Poetry of Charles d'Orleans (Into XML)

## Introduction
This is a Git repository for the ongoing study of British Library Harley MS 682, the Middle English poetry of Charles d'Orleans. 

The purpose of this project is to transcribe and produce an online version of the text of Harley MS 682. 

1. Transcribe the text from the manuscript
2. Create XML files of the text, one file per folio
3. Compile a corpus of Charles's English
4. Translate the ME text into Present Day English (a continuation of an earilier project, originally based on the transcription in *Fortunes Stabilnes* (Arn, 1994)
5. Produce an online version of the text for other readers

## Transcription and File Guidelines
Transcriptions are made from the scans of BL MS Harley 682, [available on the British Library's website](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=harley_ms_682). All characters are transcribed as seen, when possible. Scribal annotations that cannot be rendered in Unicode should be expanded.
Files should be in well-formed and valid XML and either consist of one folio (page) per file, or one poem. The divisions are still TBA since the MS consists of 294 folios, so one file per folio may not be feasable.
