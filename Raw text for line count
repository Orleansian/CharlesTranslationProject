Bi goodly speche and curteys countenaunce
The more that they ben sett as in novles

Tyme to speke and not payse in balaunce
For to nobles longith sewte of curteys speche

<T>he marchaunt wijf nay þe doughtr of burgeys
With giftis grete to fresshe them in a ray
So maist thou when ther fauoure best y gesse
But what a cherlis doughtir dawbid in clay
As strokis grete not type, nor tapp do way
The rewdisshe child so best lo shall be wynne
But loke who that most fowlist kan bigynne
<B>ut as for the thou must do othirwise
For y haue gyven thyn hert to othir place
Go forth thi wey sum goodly swete avise

And y myn eye to Bewte threw afer
And saw right well abowt hir stood a sort
That y god wot ne koude devise a wer
For gret disdayne and crewell lo daungere
They preysid [hir?] so nygh and round abowt
That what for drede not durste y in þat rowt.
Not for myn hed oo word vnto hir say
Lest that they wolde my mater ouyrthrowe
And well y thought if that myn hert so say
In suche a plite as myghty right well knowe
That to myn harme retourne hit wold [?] growe
For loue wolde that bewte shulde it kepe
And she was loth for pite was a slepe
<T>hen thought y me was best to make a bill
Bisechyng bewte of hir benygne grace							f.4r
Mi poore hert that she not suffir spill
But forto kepe as for a tymys space
Vnto y may hir fauoure more purchase
For wold she graunt me to kepe it euyrmore
Then were y hool of many a greuous sore
<A>nd if she wolde more ferre of goodlihede
To leue me not as man without hert
But graunt me loo liche to a pynnys hed
Part of hiris to that my rewd desert
To graunt me more as may hir lo conuert
And as me thought in this that y no blame
Deserued lo for which to do the same

Out of the prese unto an herber grene
As in my childisshe witt if y koude grope
Sum praty thing that myght hir plesere bene
But even liche as hit were a swarme of bene
So gan ther thoughtis to me multiply
To helpe me fynde id they koude remedy
Good hope as loo was no thing to seche
For penne and papir had he found anoon
A trouthe qd. he y here lakkith not but speche
And konnyng but allas they be my foon
O tewche qd. ho so as thou kanst do on
